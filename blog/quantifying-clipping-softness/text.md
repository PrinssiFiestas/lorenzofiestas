# Quantifying Clipping Softness

## Plan

- Create an outline (list of figures and tables).
- Begin with the experimental section.
- Write the results and discussion following the outline.
- Write (potentially numbered) conclusions.
- Write introduction.
  - Why was the study done?
  - Collect relevant background information for the reader.
- Write summary.
- Collect references. Quick notes can be written in steps before.

## Outline

- Define clipping function.
  - Mathematical rules (increasing, differentiable)
- Define clipping hardness and softness.
- Hard and soft clipping graphs.
- Hard clipping limit.
- Input and output gain effects on softness.
- Naive input gain normalization (rail-2-rail) effects on softness with high rails voltage.
- THD input gain normalization.
- Output gain normalization by standard deviation.
- Calculate exact output gain normalization.
- Introduce smoothest function.
- Smoothest function proof.
- Input gain normalization effects on smoothest function.
  - Higher gain (THD) effects.
  - Lower gain (THD) effects.
- Calculate exact input gain normalization THD based on smoothest function.
- Subjective experiment EEL2 functions.
